CARD CASINO üÉèüí≤
---
Welcome to the Card Casino Game. We have 3 mini games for you to play. You can play alone, with a partner, or with 3 other players.
To start, every player will get $1000. Every game will have an initial wager that will be decided in every start of a game. 
Every player can get more money with every win they get by playing the games.

Card Match
---
Our first mini game is Card Match, a single player memory game. In this game, you will be challenged to memorize cards within a limited time frame.

To play, follow these simple steps:
  1. Choose the board size by entering 4 or 6. The bigger the board size, the more cards will be in play.
  2. You will be given 5 seconds to memorize the card elements displayed on the board. 
  3. Enter two numbers that you think are the same.
  4. You could exit the program by enter 'e' when the player's turn start.

If you can successfully complete the game within the allotted time, you will win a prize based on your performance.
  - For the 4x4 board, if you finish in under 120 seconds, you will receive double your initial wager. If you finish in over 120 seconds, you will lose your initial wager.
  - For the 6x6 board, you can win even more! If you finish in under 3 minutes, you will receive three times your initial wager. If you finish in under 3 minutes but over 4 minute, you will receive double your initial wager. If you take over 4 minutes, you will lose your initial wager.

Get your mind ready and play to win more money!

Switch Card
---
Our second mini game is Switch Card, a double player switching game of luck. In this game, two players will compete to get the highest possible value from a combination of 5 cards.

Here's how to play:
  1. First, each player will be given 5 cards randomly chosen from a deck of 52 cards.
  2. Each player will be shown their collection of cards, but keep it hidden from your opponent. You will then have the option to either keep your cards or swap them with random cards generated from the deck.
  3. If you choose to swap your cards, you will be given the option to choose how many and which cards to swap (1-5).
  4. After both players have dealt their cards, both hands are revealed to each other. The player with the higher value of cards will win.

To calculate your score, use the following values:
  - Number cards represent their own numbers.
  - Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) represent 10.
  - Ace represents 11.

If you win, you will receive all the wager from the other player. Since it's a double or nothing game, you'll need luck on your side!

41
---
Our last game is 41, a multiplayer game that you can play with 4 players. In this game, you will be playing alongside 3 other players. The ultimate goal of the game is to get a score of 41 from a combination of 4 cards.

Here's how to play:
  1. To start the game, press "y" and hit enter.
  2. Your cards will be displayed on the screen, along with your current score. You will have the option to either keep your current hand of cards or switch one of your cards with a new card to try and get a better score.
  3. If you want to switch a card, press "y" and then choose the index of the card you want to switch (0-3). If you decide to keep your cards, press "n".
  4. All players will take turns until one player gets a score of 41.
  5. You could exit the program by enter 'e' when the player's turn start.

To calculate your score, use the following values:
  - Number cards represent their own numbers.
  - Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) represent 10.
  - Ace represents 11.

If you win, you will receive the combined wager from all players. Remember, the winner takes it all, so play and strategize well!

## Coding Requirements

### 3.1. Generation of random game sets or events

In cardMatch.cpp, shuffle() function is used from the algorithm library and an expression that creates an instance of the mt19937 random number generator engine is used to make sure every new game the elements are randomly ordered. This applies to both hidden values and shown values (there are two boards, where one is just a number that hides the true values such as ‚ÄòA‚Äô). Also, chrono library is also utilized to record player‚Äôs game time to determine whether a user can double their wager as the game. Libraries like <iomanip> and <thread> to make the texts aligned and to make the screen frozen for a while to make sure the game is enjoyable. 

In fourtyOne.cpp, a function called deal() and takeCard() is used to give a random card from the deck to the player‚Äôs hand. The function algorithm is similar with shuffle() function in cardMatch.cpp. Similarly with the 2 programs above, switchCard.cpp uses randomization in the function called shuffleDeck(), this function is used to ensure a different shuffling sequence of the card deck each time the program is run. 

---
  
### 3.2. Data structures for storing game status
  
In main.cpp, a Player struct is used to represent the player‚Äôs data, including their name stored as a string and their money stored as an integer. As the games are player and wagers are won or lost, individual player‚Äôs money are adjusted accordingly and saved into gameData.txt for storing the data. This data can then be loaded when starting another session.

In switchCard.cpp, a Card struct represents individual cards, and vectors are used for players' hands, all players' hands, and the deck. The Switch class manages the game logic, including deck generation, shuffling, dealing hands, card swapping, score calculation, and determining the winner. 

In the fourtyOne.cpp, a Card struct is used to represent individual cards with face value and suit attributes. Vectors are employed to store players' hands (vector<Card>) and all players' hands (vector<vector<Card>>). The deck is represented by a vector<Card>. As the game progresses, cards are dealt, drawn, and discarded, with the game ending when a player reaches a 41 hand value or the deck is depleted. The vector data structures provide efficient, ordered storage, while the Game class handles game logic, managing data structures for smooth gameplay.

In cardMatch.cpp, vectors are also the primary data structure employed. 2D vectors containing bool, integers, and strings are utilized to create the game board and implement the play function. Both applications demonstrate the versatility and efficiency of vectors in managing ordered data and facilitating various game mechanics.

### 3.3. Dynamic memory management 
  
In the switchCard.cpp, switch class effectively utilizes dynamic memory management to create a scalable and flexible game design. Memory is allocated dynamically for the hands vector of vectors and the deck vector, allowing the game to accommodate any number of players and hand sizes without rewriting the game logic for each combination. By leveraging C++'s dynamic memory allocation features, the Switch class remains clean, scalable, and abstracted from specific numbers of players or hand sizes. This demonstrates the importance of dynamic memory management as a key tool for creating reusable, efficient, and intuitive class designs.

The fourtyOne.cpp uses std::vector, which handles dynamic memory management internally. For example, in the createDeck() method, a vector<Card> called deck is populated with 52 Card objects. As more Cards are added, deck will automatically resize its internal buffer to accommodate them.

The cardMatch.cpp also uses vector, which handles the dynamic memory management. This saves the elements of the board including bool and strings placed on the board.

### 3.4. File input/output

Our Game Casino project features a leaderboard for all players, necessitating file input/output capabilities. We have incorporated a gameData.txt file, which resets whenever a player chooses to reset their funds or introduces a new group of players for gameplay.

---

### 3.5. Program codes in multiple files

The project is divided into several parts, each with its respective header file:

1. **main.cpp**: This file acts as the main menu, compiling all mini-games and implementing a uniform casino feature for all players. It manages players' current money,  pricing algorithms, and more.
  
2. **cardMatch.cpp**: This file contains the code for the first single-player mini-game, which involves randomly generating numbers displayed on the screen for a short period. Serving as a simple memorization game, players who win receive prize money as specified in main.cpp.
  
3. **switchCard.cpp**: This file holds the code for the second mini-game, which also uses random generation. It allows players to decide whether they want to change their hand of cards. Outcomes depend heavily on luck due to the random generation process.
  
4. **fourtyOne.cpp**: This file contains the code for the third game, designed for 4 players. In this game, players receive a random set of numbers and symbols representing cards. To win, they must create a combination of cards that equals 41.
  
5. **gameData.txt**: This text file serves as the player leaderboard, storing player names and remaining money. The gameData.txt file can be reset and is periodically read by the main code throughout the game.

### 4. List of non-standard C/C++ libraries

Non-standard libraries needed for this project:
1. #include <chrono> 
2. #include <ctime>
